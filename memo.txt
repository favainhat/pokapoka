xxx.bnd -> simple container

POKAPOKA.DBN -> pgdecrypt
should have same crc with POKAPOKA.BND after decrypt.
safe for ignore it.

3ds
ziptks -> just zlib compressed tks. zlib example code should enough to compress/decompress.
param -> some paramater for game? might not need for translation. contains shift-jis chars.
fmg -> contain scripts. shift-jis or unicode chars depend on header. 


menu.arc -> nintendo sarc. 
bffnt -> 3ds(wiiu) font.
BFLYT... etc -> image or layout.
There is many tools that can handle this. Like Kuriimu.
